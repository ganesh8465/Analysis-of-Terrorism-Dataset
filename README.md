# Terrorism Hotspot Analysis 1970-2020

In this project we are analyzing data from GTD about terror attacks in the last 50 years. The data got extracted, cleaned, transformed into a suitable format and ran some Exploratory analysis to fully grasp the data we have at hand. We then follow up with designing an interactive Tableau Dashboard.

Link to the raw data can be found in the beginning of my Jupyter Notebook. An excel file is provided for the lazy ones among you. 

Also provided is a pdf file with info about each column of data that we are dealing with. 

Lastly, a CSV file with the clean data that I used for Tableau is available.
